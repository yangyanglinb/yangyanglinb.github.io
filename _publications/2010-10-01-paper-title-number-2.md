## Abstract
Time series forecasting plays an essential role in many fields, such as financial analysis, climate forecasting, and energy demand.  
This study proposes an enhanced dilated convolutional (DC) AutoConNet architecture for accurate long-term forecasting of complex time series.  
By integrating multi-scale dilated convolution, layer normalization, and a novel adaptive rescaling mechanism (ARM), the model improves robustness and generalization across diverse datasets.

Experiments on 16 standard datasets (M4, M5, ETTh1/2, ETTm1/2, traffic, weather, disease, exchange rate, etc.) demonstrate that the proposed ARM-DC AutoConNet:  
- significantly reduces SMAPE and MASE,  
- achieves more stable predictions in long forecasting horizons,  
- outperforms the original AutoConNet in most scenarios.

This work provides a feasible and efficient solution for reliable long-term forecasting and inspires future developments in deep learning for time series.
