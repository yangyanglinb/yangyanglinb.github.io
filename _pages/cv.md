Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on deep learning and representation learning models, 
combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Self-Supervised Learning for visual 
and temporal data understanding. 

Education
======
* Aug 2023 – Feb 2026 · Faculty of Engineering and Technology,  
  Panyapiwat Institute of Management, Thailand  
  *Full scholarship* 

* Sep 2021 – Jun 2023 · Faculty of Computer Science and Technology,  
  Nanjing Tech University Pujiang Institute, China 

Research Experience
======
* **Graph-aware Time–Frequency Contrastive Learning Framework (contrastive-twfreq)**  
  *Aug 2025 – present*
  * Proposed an innovative time–frequency contrastive learning mechanism, combining 
    frequency-sliced dynamic adjacency with time-weighted InfoNCE loss for 
    structure-aware temporal representation learning.  
  * Performed graph-structure fusion of time–frequency features: used Graph Neural 
    Networks (GNNs) to capture inter-variate dependencies and to model multi-scale 
    time-series features in the frequency domain.  
  * Built a complete and reproducible framework including self-supervised training, 
    linear probes, ablation experiments and visualization modules, runnable on 
    datasets such as METR-LA and PEMS-BAY.  

* **A Novel ARM-DC AutoConNet for Accurate Long-Term Time-Series Forecasting**  
  *Sep 2024 – Aug 2025* 
  * Proposed the ARM-DC AutoConNet architecture with Adaptive Rescaling Mechanism (ARM) 
    and Multi-scale Dilated Convolution (DC).  
  * Introduced Layer Normalization and Residual Connections to maintain stable 
    convergence for long-sequence prediction.  
  * Designed a multi-index composite loss function.  
  * Achieved significant performance gains with a lightweight design.  
  * Evaluated on 16 public datasets (e.g., M4, M5, ETTh1, ETTm1, Traffic, etc.), 
    obtaining up to ~95% MSE reduction and ~77% MAE reduction.  

* **Using YOLOv3 for Vehicle Tracking in DonkeyCar**  
  *Sep 2023 – Jul 2025*
  * Proposed a dual-vehicle cooperative autonomous driving method that fuses YOLOv3 
    visual detection with control algorithms to realize front-vehicle tracking and 
    obstacle avoidance in the DonkeyCar simulation environment.  
  * Demonstrated the reliability of multi-vehicle collaboration using only cameras, 
    maintaining stable tracking even under sensor failure or occlusion, thereby 
    verifying YOLOv3’s detection and control performance in dynamic multi-vehicle scenarios.  

Work Experience
======
* **University Teacher**  
  *Oct 2025 – present* 
  * Teaching computer fundamentals and professional courses, including web front-end 
    development and Windows services.  

* **E-commerce Operations**  
  *Mar 2023 – Jul 2023* 
  * Responsible for daily operations and management of e-commerce stores.
